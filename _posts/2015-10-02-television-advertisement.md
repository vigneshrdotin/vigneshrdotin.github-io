I have seen many large electronics corporations do showcase their television product in the Ads. Sometimes they talk about quality of the picture contrast ration pixel density. Funny part is most of the people watch in different television which is almost will no way be compared to the TV shown in the Ads.

Like above videos many used to split the screens in the advertisement and showcase that their product is better. My question is does it generate any value to the customer. For example when some organisation displayed some ads to showcase their picture quality is really good, I was watching it through my television which displayed the pretty perfectly then why should I change it? 

Note: I am not here blame any Ad agencies or any corporate. I am just presenting my thoughts.
