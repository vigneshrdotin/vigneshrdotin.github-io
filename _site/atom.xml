   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a long weekend, So I planned a travel to Chennai to visit my friends. As usual booked a ticket in RedBus to travel and got into pickup bus. To my surprise, the bus was full and I was asked to stand with assurance from the driver that it will not take more than 15 min. There was a guy who was sitting, looked at me and smiled, I didn&amp;#39;t know the reason at that time but when it took an hour to reach Majestic(Bangalore Bus Terminus), I just smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was standing in the bus, I took my phone and informed my sister that I boarded the bus. After pinging her, I just glanced away from the phone to find a surprise that everyone in the bus where using WhatsApp. No, I haven&amp;#39;t read at other people conversation. I was thinking, Mark you made a good purchase. Then I was analysing what caused people to use WhatsApp to be precise what caused people to turn WhatsApping as their behaviour to talk to friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective following are the points that make me believe things that make WhatsApp a big success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though they say that they are freemium and people have to pay $1 after a year of use, I don&amp;#39;t remember that I ever paid them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They really concentrated on the developing markets like India, Brazil and made their app work on even the weakest network and cheap phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network effect: People brought in other people to the app because they found value in it and wanted to share the same with their friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundling with carriers to provide free data for using WhatsApp, I think this is the groundbreaking move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get additional thoughts, will update. If you also do have some thoughts, please comment below lets have a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being overall said, I really like WhatsApp team because they taught me how to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stay lean and move faster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this video in my facebook feed, which is like amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always do wonder how come so many businessman without an MBA or any business degrees were able to run a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I think, I got part of an answer, these people get it correct by doing things and getting failed or by looking at others failure in their business.&lt;/p&gt;
