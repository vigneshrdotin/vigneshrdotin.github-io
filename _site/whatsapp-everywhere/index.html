        <p>It is a long weekend, So I planned a travel to Chennai to visit my friends. As usual booked a ticket in RedBus to travel and got into pickup bus. To my surprise, the bus was full and I was asked to stand with assurance from the driver that it will not take more than 15 min. There was a guy who was sitting, looked at me and smiled, I didn&#39;t know the reason at that time but when it took an hour to reach Majestic(Bangalore Bus Terminus), I just smiled back.</p>

<p>When I was standing in the bus, I took my phone and informed my sister that I boarded the bus. After pinging her, I just glanced away from the phone to find a surprise that everyone in the bus where using WhatsApp. No, I haven&#39;t read at other people conversation. I was thinking, Mark you made a good purchase. Then I was analysing what caused people to use WhatsApp to be precise what caused people to turn WhatsApping as their behaviour to talk to friends.</p>

<p>From my perspective following are the points that make me believe things that make WhatsApp a big success.</p>

<ul>
<li>Even though they say that they are freemium and people have to pay $1 after a year of use, I don&#39;t remember that I ever paid them</li>
<li>They really concentrated on the developing markets like India, Brazil and made their app work on even the weakest network and cheap phone</li>
<li>Network effect: People brought in other people to the app because they found value in it and wanted to share the same with their friends</li>
<li>Bundling with carriers to provide free data for using WhatsApp, I think this is the groundbreaking move</li>
</ul>

<p>If I get additional thoughts, will update. If you also do have some thoughts, please comment below lets have a discussion.</p>

<p>Being overall said, I really like WhatsApp team because they taught me how to <strong><em>stay lean and move faster</em></strong>.</p>
